# 🤖 ChatGPT Excel Automation (Agent Mode)

A fully automated **Python + Playwright** workflow that connects to a running Chrome session and controls **ChatGPT’s Agent Mode** to upload Excel files, issue prompts, and automatically download the AI-generated results — all without any manual clicks.

2. Finding an open ChatGPT tab  
3. Uploading an Excel file  
4. Sending a prompt for analysis  
5. Waiting for AI processing  
6. Detecting and downloading the generated spreadsheet  

It is designed for **reliability, transparency, and async performance**, using robust DOM-query fallbacks and retry logic for dynamic UI states.
